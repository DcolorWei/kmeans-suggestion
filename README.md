## Instruction
A suggestion algorithm implemented using kmeans clustering analysis. It could give you the suggestions with specific data or data array from origin data deck.

## Using
First, install the kmeans-suggestion.

After installation, you can import it into your project. I have exported three package include commonJS, es6 and umd, for different environment so that you can use it in node and browser.

## Example
There are some examples for your convenience.

```
// commonJS
const kmeans = require('kmeans-suggestion');

// ES6 Module
import kmeans from 'kmeans-suggestion';

// UMD
const kmeans = require('kmeans-suggestion/dist/umd/index.js');
